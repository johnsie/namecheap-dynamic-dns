# namecheap-dynamic-dns #

## Overview ##

namecheap-dynamic-dns is an open source clone of [Namecheap's own dynamic DNS client](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/111/11/using-namecheap-dynamic-dns-client--version-20x-beta).

I created it primarily because Namecheap's client would not minimize to the
system tray.

The application requires the [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework-runtime/net472).
